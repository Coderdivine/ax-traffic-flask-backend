## Introduction

The AX Traffic Flask backend serves as the server-side component for the AX Traffic web application. It handles requests from the frontend, processes data, and communicates with external services or databases if needed. The backend provides the necessary functionality to retrieve traffic data, process it, and deliver it to the frontend for display.

## Installation

To install and run the AX Traffic Flask backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Coderdivine/ax-traffic-flask-backend.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd ax-traffic-flask-backend
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the backend, you need to configure the necessary settings. Copy the `config.example.py` file and rename it to `config.py`. Open the `config.py` file and provide the required configuration values. These may include database credentials, API keys, or any other necessary configuration variables.

## Usage

To run the AX Traffic Flask backend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment as described in the installation steps.

2. Run the following command to start the backend server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. The backend server should now be running and listening for requests on `http://localhost:5000`.

4. Access the AX Traffic web application frontend (located separately) and make requests to the backend APIs.

## API Endpoints

The AX Traffic Flask backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/traffic`: Retrieves traffic data from an external source.
- `GET /api/traffic/average`: Retrieves average traffic data for a specific time period.
- `POST /api/traffic`: Submits new traffic data.
- `GET /api/traffic/:id`: Retrieves traffic data for a specific ID.
- `PUT /api/traffic/:id`: Updates traffic data for a specific ID.
- `DELETE /api/traffic/:id`: Deletes traffic data for a specific ID.

Please refer to the API documentation or code implementation for further details on each endpoint, including request/response formats and authentication requirements.
